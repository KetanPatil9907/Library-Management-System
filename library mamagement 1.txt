We are going to create a README.md file for the Library Management System project. The README should include: - Project title and description - Technologies used - Features - Setup instructions - API documentation - Frontend usage - Screenshots (if available, but since we don't have any, we can skip or mention that the UI is provided by the Flask app) - License (if any, but the code doesn't specify so we can omit or add a note)
Since we don't have actual screenshots, we can describe the frontend briefly.

Let's structure the README:

Project Title and Description
Technologies
Features
Setup and Installation
Running the Application
API Endpoints Documentation
Frontend Overview
Contributing
License (if any)
We'll write the content accordingly.

Here's a comprehensive README.md file for your Library Management System project:
